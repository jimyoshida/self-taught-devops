## Timeline

### 1930s

Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.
The original system was shown to be logically inconsistent in 1935.
The lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics.

A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
Alan Turing invented the "a-machine" (automatic machine) in 1936.
It was Turing's doctoral advisor, Alonzo Church, who later coined the term "Turing machine" in a review.

### 1940s

In computer programming, assembly language is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.
The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work.

### 1950s

Regular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular events.

Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use.
John McCarthy developed Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
First appeared: 1958

### 1960s

Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, Simula I and Simula 67, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard.
Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and featured garbage collection.
First appeared: 1962

ed is a line editor for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
The ed text editor was one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating system — assembler, editor, and shell — developed by Ken Thompson in August 1969 on a PDP-7 at AT&T Bell Labs.

Hoare logic is a formal system with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs. It was proposed in 1969 by the British computer scientist and logician Tony Hoare, and subsequently refined by Hoare and other researchers.

### 1970s

C is a middle-level, general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.
C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.
First appeared: 1972

Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language. It was designed and created in part for educational use.
Smalltalk was the product of research led by Alan Kay at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).

Make First appeared: April 1976

vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system.
The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley.

AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.
AWK was initially developed in 1977 by Alfred Aho (author of egrep), Peter J. Weinberger (who worked on tiny relational databases), and Brian Kernighan.

Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix release in March 1978.
According to Joy, many of the ideas in this visual mode were taken from Bravo—the bimodal text editor developed at Xerox PARC for the Alto.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as K&R, served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as "K&R C".
