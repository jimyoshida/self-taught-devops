# Digital Skill Bird View

This site attempts to make a comprehensive collection of digital skill maps which contain essential concepts, de-facto standards, useful technologies, and techniques etc. for DX promoters.
The initial versions started with skills of DevOps engineers, but now it has been extended for promoting digital transformation.
To build flexible, intuitive, reasonable, and profitable systems, then to replace the legacy workloads, the person-in-chage must learn a broad range of knowledge.
Thus, this site assembles all such relevant domains - BizDataML_LLM_DevSecOps.

In addition, to understand the background of the technologies etc., each section contains the timeline of those items.
The descriptions are mainly quoted from the [Wikipedia English version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) unless other references are noted.

The contents consist of the following 6 major classes as of now, and they are classified like [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) system.

- [Class 000 - Agile, management, and general works](cls0/README.md)
- [Class 100 - Programming](cls1/README.md)
- [Class 200 - OS, network, and infrastructure](cls2/README.md)
- [Class 300 - WWW and applications](cls3/README.md)
- [Class 400 - Security and privacy](cls4/README.md)
- [Class 500 - Data, ML, and LLM](cls5/README.md)

Thanks to today's LLMs trained by useful open documents and texts, you will be able to learn the details of the skills with the AI chatbots.

## Motivations

- I want a curation list which contains multiple programming language cultures
- I want a curation list which covers all key techs used in today's dynamic web systems

## Backlogs

- Build the web site and host it
- Reconsider about the license
- Make a document of how to use the Makefile
